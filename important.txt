Close all you tabs right now and hand the links over to VIL - Very Important Links.
Never lose your links again, simply hand it over!
Very Important Person - VIP, Very Important Link - VIL
You are as connected as your links, keep them alive on VIL!

VPL is an MVP project I'm hoping will make our worklife easier.
Later support will be added to install this as a browser extesion.

VPL aims to make our worklife easier by helping us to save time. It enables you to
easily save and organize your important links for later in a hassle-free manner.

People keep including me keep a terrific amount of open tabs at once simply because
they don't want to lose their links. I once lost a link and later searched so hard to 
find it all to no avail! It was painful to lose that important piece of information
just becuase I no longer have access to the link where it resides. This is where VPL
comes in. Simply move over and save them for free in an easily accessible manner and 
move on. When you are ready, simply come back to VPL and continue from where you 
stopped.
